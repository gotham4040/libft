## Description

The Libft project is a custom C library created as part of the 42 school curriculum.
This library contains a collection of essential functions that are commonly used in C programming.
Beyond the required functions, I have not only completed the bonus part of the project,
but also added some additional functions of my own.
These extra functions have expanded the library's functionality and provide additional utility for C programming tasks.
